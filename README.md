<!-- Bio -->

<div>

<p>
I'm just a guy learning to code 🧑‍💻. I'm fascinated by all-things regarding the world of tech , and love the idea of creating products that can help someone's life for the better ✨. If I'm not learning some new tech 📚, or working on a personal project, I'm chilling with a cup of coffee by my side ☕️.

</p>

<p>
I work mostly with React and Express to make web apps, but for my other projects, I usually just work with Python and with the PySimpleGui library if the need for a Gui arises 🤷‍♂️. However, at the end of the day, I'm just a guy learning to code 🙃.
</p>

<p>
 I'm Always down to collaborate when I have the time. I'm hoping to become a better developer and one day disrupt the tech ecosystem with a cool project 🚀.
